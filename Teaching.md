### About
I am a postdoctoral researcher studying repetitive DNA genomics in the Larracuente Lab at the University of Rochester. I recieved my PhD in Integrative Biology from Oregon State University in 2018 under the mentorship of David Maddison. My PhD work focused on the species delimitation, taxonomy, and repetitive DNA dynamics in ground beetles (Carabidae) in the _breve_ species group of _Bembidion_.  an. . Prior to my PhD I completed a Master's degree in Biology at Brigham Young University under the mentorship of Dennis Shiozawa.

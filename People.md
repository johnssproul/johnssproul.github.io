Science is hard work. We believe our science will be better if we create a space where the scientists can be happy.

I am an evolutionary biologist studying the evolution of genomes and species through the lens of repeitive DNA elements. Prior to joining faculty at the University of Nebraska at Omaha I was a postdoctoral researcher studying repetitive DNA genomics under the mentorship of Dr. Amanda Larracuente at the University of Rochester. I recieved my PhD in Integrative Biology from Oregon State University in 2018 under the mentorship of Dr. David Maddison. My PhD work focused on species delimitation, taxonomy, and repetitive DNA dynamics in ground beetles (Carabidae) in the _breve_ species group of _Bembidion_. Prior to my PhD I completed a Master's degree in Biology at Brigham Young University studying aquatic insect phylogeography under the mentorship of Dr. Dennis Shiozawa.

The biological world is so varied and intricate and I love challenge of discovering its diversity and understanding its complexity. I love seeing projects progress from an outline of ideas on a whiteboard to completed manuscripts.  Learning alongside students and colleagues--the people and relationships--are the best part of the process.
